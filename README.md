# AI-Driven Phone Bill Statement Analyzer & Nudge Engine

## Project Intent

Modern consumers receive complex, data-rich statements from service providers-especially for phone usage. Yet, most people rarely analyze these documents, missing opportunities to save money or adjust their habits. Existing apps focus on budgeting and transaction tracking, but few (if any) offer a user-friendly way to upload statements (like phone bills), extract meaningful data, and receive personalized, actionable insights with a human touch.

This project aims to fill that gap by building an AI-powered tool that:

- **Extracts structured data from phone bill PDFs**  
- **Transforms the data into a usable CSV format**
- **Analyzes usage patterns, charges, and anomalies**
- **Delivers engaging, personalized nudges to help users save money or better understand their habits**

## Why This Project Matters

- **Empowerment through Awareness:**  
  Many consumers are unaware of their usage trends or hidden fees. By surfacing this information in an accessible way, users gain control over their spending.

- **Behavioral Nudges:**  
  Inspired by behavioral economics, the project aims to go beyond dry analytics. It will generate witty, motivational, or thought-provoking messages that encourage positive change-making financial wellness less intimidating and more engaging.

- **AI for Good:**  
  Leveraging AI for document extraction and insight generation allows for automation of tedious tasks and delivers value that adapts to each user's unique situation.

- **Market Gap:**  
  While financial apps exist, few provide seamless, AI-driven statement analysis with a focus on actionable, human-centered guidance-especially for non-banking statements like phone bills.

## Example Use Cases

- **Phone Plan Optimization:**  
  "You made 80% of your calls after 8pm-switching to an evening plan could save you $12/month."

- **Behavioral Insights:**  
  "Your longest call last month was with your sister, lasting 2 hours. Family first!"

- **Anomaly Detection:**  
  "Data usage spiked 300% during your vacation. Consider a travel add-on next time."

- **Cost Awareness:**  
  "You’re paying $5/month for a voicemail feature you haven’t used in 6 months."

## Project Roadmap (WIP)

1. **PDF Parsing Module:**  
   Extract structured data from various phone bill formats.

2. **CSV Transformation:**  
   Normalize extracted data for analysis.

3. **AI Analysis Engine:**  
   Identify patterns, anomalies, and savings opportunities.

4. **Nudge Generator:**  
   Craft personalized, engaging messages based on analysis.

5. **User Interface:**  
   Simple, privacy-focused dashboard for uploads and insights.

## Vision

By automating the tedious and surfacing the insightful-with a dash of personality-this project seeks to help everyday people make smarter, happier choices about their phone usage and spending.
